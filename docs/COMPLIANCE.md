GDPR: personal data = email; purpose = auth; retention: per buyer policy.
Access logs: audit_logs is tamper-evident; retention per buyer policy.
PSD2/EBA: strong customer authentication left to buyer policy stack; current scope is internal admin/demo quality.

Recommended:
- Retain audit >= 1 year (bank policy may require 5â€“7).
- Export logs to SIEM (Syslog/HTTP collector).
